# DataScience

# This was a project in our Data Science class where we took the breast cancer data set and made predictions. We cleaned the data and ran a logistic regression model and a random forest model. We where able to predict with 93%(logistic regression) and 94%(random forest) accuracy if a tumor was malignant or benign based on certain measurements of the tumor.
